# **Hey there ðŸ‘‹**

Iâ€™m Nour Safa. I am a Computer Science graduate from the American University of Beirut (AUB). And I am now pursuing my Masterâ€™s in Computer Science at McGill University.

ðŸŽ“ At McGill, my focus is on AI and cybersecurity. My thesis research explores Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs), and how they can be engineered into robust, secure, and scalable systems.

ðŸ’¼ Beyond academia, Iâ€™ve gained industry experience in data science, applied AI, and frontend developmentâ€”building pipelines, deploying ML models, and designing user-facing applications that bring real-world impact.

Here youâ€™ll find projects Iâ€™ve built over the yearsâ€”spanning software engineering, web and mobile apps, machine learning, databases, and cloud systems.

Thanks for stopping byâ€”feel free to explore my repos, and I hope they reflect the same passion I put into learning, building, and sharing. ðŸš€
