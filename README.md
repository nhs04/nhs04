# **Hey there ðŸ‘‹**

Iâ€™m Nour Safa, a Computer Science graduate from the American University of Beirut (AUB).

Here youâ€™ll find projects I worked on during my time at AUB. I explored software development, mobile apps, machine learning, databases, cloud, and much more.

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m really into data science, software development, and using tech to create things that matter. I think data is full of stories just waiting to be discovered ðŸ“ŠðŸ“–

ðŸŽ“ Next up, Iâ€™m heading to McGill to do my Masterâ€™s in Computer Science, and Iâ€™ll be focusing my thesis on data science and AI.

ðŸŒ± Right now, Iâ€™m learning more about machine learning, data science, and cybersecurity.

Thanks for checking out my workâ€”I hope you enjoy exploring my repos! ðŸ˜Š
