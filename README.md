# **Hey there ðŸ‘‹**

Iâ€™m Nour Safa, a Computer Science graduate from the American University of Beirut (AUB) and now a Masterâ€™s student in Computer Science at McGill University.

Here youâ€™ll find projects Iâ€™ve worked on over the yearsâ€”covering software development, mobile apps, machine learning, databases, cloud, and more.

ðŸŽ“ At McGill, Iâ€™m specializing in AI and cybersecurity, with a research focus on Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Large Language Models (LLMs), and how they can be applied to build smarter, more secure systems.

ðŸŒ± Always learningâ€”right now, Iâ€™m diving deeper into advanced machine learning, data science, and cybersecurity.

Thanks for stopping byâ€”hope you enjoy exploring my repos! ðŸ˜Š
