# **Hey there ğŸ‘‹**

Iâ€™m Nour Safa, a Computer Science Student at the American University of Beirut.  

ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in data science, software development, and creating impactful solutions through technology.  
I see data as stories waiting to be toldâ€”every dataset has a hidden narrative to uncover! ğŸ“–ğŸ“Š  

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced concepts in machine learning, data science, and cybersecurity.
